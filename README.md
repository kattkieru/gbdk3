Gameboy Development Kit v3
==========================

If you got here through some search, I apologize, but this is not as exciting as you were thinking.

Currently this project contains four sub-repos, two of which are useful:

gambatte: bootstrap build of gambatte-sdl (macOS)
sdcc: bootstrap build of the SDCC compiler toolchain for Gameboy (macOS)

More is coming, but there is no timeline.
